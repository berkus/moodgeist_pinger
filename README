Moodgeist pinger for Linux Skype
--------------------------------

Requirements:
 - libcurl

Building:
 - type make

Running:
 Run ./moodgeist_pinger. Pinger itself forks and detaches from console.
 It will connect to Skype, the popup will show asking to allow access, press Yes.
 If you press No, the pinger will immediately quit.
 It will exit gracefully if you send it any signal, so `killall moodgeist_pinger` will do.

Have fun!
